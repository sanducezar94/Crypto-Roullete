# Crypto-Roullete

A small project which tries to integrate Harmony Network Chain Smart Contracts with a gambling game. The users can make crypto deposits by using the Harmony Chain governance token $ONE.



This project is a WIP

TO DO & IMPROVEMENTS: 
	1. Create a new ERC20 Token which will be used to play the game, stake, provide liquidity and withdraw.
	2. Create a jackpot pool which will have a chance to pop, rewarding the winners
	3. Create a NFT Jackpot pool 
	4. Create a separate room for a Lottery, each ticket bought will contribute to the winning pool with 90% of it's value. 
		Reward users a free lottery ticket for every 10-15 bets on the roullete. (the house will have to add 50% of the ticket value to the winning pool)
