This project is a WIP

TO DO & IMPROVEMENTS: (maybe)
	
	
		Deploy roullete smart contract and integrate with the server
		Create a new ERC20 Token which will be used to play the game
		Create a jackpot pool which will have a chance to pop, rewarding the winners
		Create a separate room for a Lottery, each ticket bought will contribute to the winning pool with 90% of it's value. 
		Reward users a free lottery ticket for every 10-15 bets on the roullete. (the house will have to add 50% of the ticket value to the winning pool)
